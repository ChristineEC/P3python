Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **May 14, 2024**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!


### Credits

I learned the code for centering text in the terminal from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_ref_string_center2).

I got the idea to us an os method to get the width of the player's terminal from Marko's hangman game in GitHub, which he so kindly shared with me while I was developing this game.

When it came time to make the game more user friendly in terms of clearing unnecessary text from the terminal, I remembered that Marko mentioned a method to do this in his README file. I could see that he used an os method involving 'cls', but I wanted to understand it better before using it. I found some information on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63855637/clearing-the-terminal-for-my-python-text-adventure) and then felt I was ready to use the method (i.e., clear = lambda:os.system('cls') and then just clear() on a function in my game as necessary). Many thanks to Marko for the idea and to Stack Overflow for enabling me to understand the method.
